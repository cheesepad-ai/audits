### Summary

This is a standard `ERC20` token implementation using OpenZeppelin v5.x patterns with no owner/admin controls, no taxes, and no transfer restrictions. The constructor is payable and forwards an exact deployment fee to a specified `feeReceiver`, then mints the entire `totalSupply` to the deployer. No upgradeability, no blacklist/whitelist, and no hidden hooks are present. Overall Risk: LOW – Minimal attack surface, standard OZ logic, no privileged controls.

### Risk Assessment

**Token Quick Facts:**

| Property | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Buy Tax | None | ✅ Low |
| Sell Tax | None | ✅ Low |
| Max Transaction | None | ✅ Reasonable |
| Contract Type | Standard | Info |
| Ownership | None (no owner role) | ✅ Safe |
| Pause Function | No | ✅ No restrictions |

**Security Assessment:**

| Category | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Security | Low | Standard `ERC20`; no external calls post-deploy; no custom hooks |
| Centralization | Low | No owner/admin; no upgradeability |
| Code Quality | Low | Clean OZ-based; decimals immutable; no suspicious assembly |
| Exploit Likelihood | Low | No fees/blacklist; minimal logic surface |
| **Overall Risk Score** | **100/100** | No findings across critical/high/medium/low |

## On-Chain Function Results

| Function | On-Chain Value | Explanation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `decimals()` | `18` | Number of decimal places for token units |
| `name()` | `Julius Caesar` | Contract name identifier |
| `symbol()` | `CAESAR` | Ticker symbol used by exchanges/wallets |
| `totalSupply()` | `100000000000000000000000000` | Total tokens ever created (100,000,000 with 18 decimals) |

### Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Key Issues |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Critical | 0 | — |
| High | 0 | — |
| Medium | 0 | — |
| Low | 0 | — |

### Critical Findings

None.

### Good Practices

- Uses unmodified OpenZeppelin-style `ERC20` (v5.x pattern with `_update`) and `IERC20` interfaces
- No owner/admin roles, eliminating centralization/privilege risk
- No taxes, no blacklist/whitelist, no max wallet/tx limits
- `decimals` stored as `immutable` for gas efficiency
- No upgradeability/proxy logic; immutable behavior
- Constructor’s external call occurs only once at deployment, minimizing reentrancy surface

### Tokenomics Analysis

| Feature | Value/Status | Risk Assessment |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Contract Type | Standard | Low |
| Upgrade Control | None (no proxy) | Low |
| Ownership Status | None (No owner role) | Low |
| Owner Address | N/A | — |
| Total Supply | 100,000,000 (18 decimals) | Low |
| Buy Tax | 0% | Low |
| Sell Tax | 0% | Low |
| Max Transaction | None | Low |

The token mints the full supply to the deployer at construction and provides no mint/burn functions thereafter (beyond internal `_mint/_burn` which are unused externally). There are no fee mechanics, liquidity controls, or hidden transfer conditions, so rug-pull vectors via tax/blacklist are absent. The payable constructor forwards exactly `feeAmount_` to `feeReceiver` using a direct `call`; this affects deployment only and has no runtime impact on users.

No indication of fake renunciation patterns as there is no `Ownable` or alternative admin role to begin with. No proxy or upgradeability is present; behavior is fixed at deployment.

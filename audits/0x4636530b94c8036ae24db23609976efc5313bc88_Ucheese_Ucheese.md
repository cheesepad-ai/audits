## 🤖 Analysis #1: GPT-5

**Completed:** Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:46:27 GMT

### Summary

This is a standard `ERC20` token (`CpboxToken`) built on OpenZeppelin v5.3.0 with a customizable `decimals()` override and a one-time initial mint to the deployer. There are no fees, no blacklist/whitelist, no pausing, and no owner/admin roles or upgradeability. Overall, the code is minimal and clean; the primary risk is token distribution centralization at deployment. Overall Risk: LOW - Simple, unupgradeable ERC20; only distribution centralization risk.

### Risk Assessment

**Token Quick Facts:**

| Property | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Buy Tax | None | ✅ Low |
| Sell Tax | None | ✅ Low |
| Max Transaction | None | ✅ Reasonable |
| Contract Type | Standard `ERC20` | Info |
| Ownership | No `owner`/no `Ownable` | ✅ Safe (no admin) |
| Pause Function | No | ✅ No restrictions |

**Security Assessment:**

| Category | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Security | Low | Minimal, standard OZ `ERC20`, no external calls |
| Centralization | Medium | Entire initial supply minted to deployer |
| Code Quality | Low | Uses OZ v5.3.0 patterns, clear and minimal |
| Exploit Likelihood | Low | No complex logic; low attack surface |
| **Overall Risk Score** | **97/100** | One medium finding (distribution centralization) |

## On-Chain Function Results

The following functions were called on-chain at block 72219154. The table below shows the results:

| Function | On-Chain Value | Explanation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `decimals()` | `18` | Number of decimal places for token balances |
| `name()` | `Ucheese` | Token name identifier used by wallets |
| `symbol()` | `Ucheese` | Ticker symbol used in UIs and exchanges |
| `totalSupply()` | `1000000000000000000000000000` | Total tokens minted at deployment (includes 18 decimals) |

### Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Key Issues |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Critical | 0 | — |
| High | 0 | — |
| Medium | 1 | Initial supply centralized to deployer |
| Low | 0 | — |

### Critical Findings

No critical findings identified.

### High Findings

No high findings identified.

### Medium Findings

#### 🟡 [M-1] Centralization Risk: Entire Initial Supply Minted to Deployer

**Description:**
All tokens are minted to the deployer at construction. There are no vesting/lock mechanisms or safeguards to prevent large sell-offs or treasury misuse.

```solidity
constructor(
    uint256 initialSupply,
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    uint8 decimals_
) ERC20(name, symbol) {
    _decimals = decimals_;
    _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Deployer can immediately sell or transfer the full supply, potentially causing a price crash or perceived rug.
- No enforced vesting/lock or distribution transparency on-chain.

**Location:**
`constructor` in `CpboxToken` (initial mint to `msg.sender`)

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:** Mitigate centralization risk off-chain or via additional contracts:
> 1. Lock/vesting contracts for team/treasury allocations
> 2. Publicly disclose distribution plans and lock addresses
> 3. Consider minting directly to multisig-controlled wallets
> - Alternative: If supply must be centralized, communicate risk clearly to users

### Good Practices

- Uses unmodified OpenZeppelin `ERC20` v5.3.0 implementation patterns
- No `Ownable`/admin roles; no backdoors, no tax logic, no blacklist
- No external calls; minimal attack surface
- Not upgradeable; immutable logic

### Tokenomics Analysis

| Feature | Value/Status | Risk Assessment |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Contract Type | Standard `ERC20` | Low |
| Upgrade Control | None (no proxy, no upgradeability) | Low |
| Ownership Status | No owner/admin | Low |
| Owner Address | N/A | — |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000.000000000 (with 18 decimals) | Low |
| Buy Tax | None | Low |
| Sell Tax | None | Low |
| Max Transaction | None | Low |

Detailed analysis:
- No fee/tax, blacklist, max tx, or pausable mechanisms—no embedded transfer restrictions or honeypot vectors from code.
- Token distribution risk: Entire supply minted to deployer; downstream trust depends on off-chain commitments (locking, vesting, liquidity provision).
- No mint/burn functions exposed publicly; supply is fixed post-deployment due to absence of admin roles.

Library and backdoor verification:
- OpenZeppelin `ERC20` v5.3.0 appears unmodified. No hidden admins, altered `SafeMath` (not used/needed on 0.8+), or tampered access control.
- No ownership variables, no `restoreOwner`, no alternative admin paths—no fake renunciation possible since there is no owner pattern at all.

Balanced assessment:
- The contract’s simplicity and immutability reduce technical risk.
- The principal risk is token distribution centralization and off-chain operational practices (e.g., liquidity locks, treasury custody).
- No upgradeability; therefore no risk of malicious upgrades.

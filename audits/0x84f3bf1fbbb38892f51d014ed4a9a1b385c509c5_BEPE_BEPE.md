## 🤖 Analysis #1: GPT-5

**Completed:** Mon, 05 Jan 2026 02:17:22 GMT

### Summary

`BEPE` is a standard `ERC20` token with 9 decimals that implements fixed buy/sell taxes (2% each) routed to team wallets via token swaps. Notable features include trading gating pre-launch, fee exemptions, and automatic conversion of collected fees into a non-bluechip token (`USD1`) and distribution to `marketingAddress` and `devAddress`. The contract is not upgradeable and shows a standard `Ownable` pattern with no hidden backdoors detected. Overall Risk: MEDIUM - Centralized control over tax routing and funds, MEV exposure in swaps, and reliance on an arbitrary `USD1` token.

#### 🟠 [H-1] Tax Conversion Routes to Arbitrary `USD1` Token (Liquidity/Price Control Risk)

**Description:**
Collected taxes are swapped from `BEPE` into `USD1` via a hardcoded route `[BEPE -> USD1]`, and the pair is created against `USD1` in the constructor. Using a non-bluechip token for tax conversion concentrates risk: if `USD1` is illiquid or controlled by insiders, conversions can occur at adverse or manipulated prices, effectively extracting more value than the nominal 2% tax.

```solidity
address public immutable USD1 = 0x8d0D000Ee44948FC98c9B98A4FA4921476f08B0d;

lpPair = IDexFactory(dexRouter.factory()).createPair(
    address(this),
    USD1
);

function swapTokensForUSD1(uint256 tokenAmt, address recipient) private {
    address[] memory path = new address[](2);
    path[0] = address(this);
    path[1] = USD1;

    dexRouter.swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
        tokenAmt,
        0,
        path,
        recipient,
        block.timestamp
    );
}
```

**Impact:**
- If `USD1` liquidity is shallow or controlled, tax conversions can be executed at unfavorable rates, amplifying effective fees beyond 2%.
- Insiders can manipulate `USD1` pool pricing to capture value from conversions.
- Users bear hidden price impact through ongoing sell pressure into a potentially illiquid market.

**Location:**
`constructor`, `swapTokensForUSD1()`, `convertTaxes()`, and `handleTax()` usage.

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:**
> 1. Use a deep-liquidity, widely traded asset for conversions (e.g., `WETH`/`WBNB`, `USDT`/`USDC`).
> 2. If `USD1` must be used, publish its code, supply, and liquidity policies; add governance/multisig controls over any `USD1` liquidity operations.
> 3. Allow configurable multi-hop paths (e.g., `BEPE -> WBNB -> USDT`) with slippage protections.

#### 🟡 [M-1] Unbounded Slippage in Tax Swaps Enables MEV/Price Manipulation

**Description:**
Tax conversions use `swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` with `amountOutMin = 0`, allowing any output and exposing swaps to sandwich attacks and price manipulation.

```solidity
dexRouter.swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
    tokenAmt,
    0, // amountOutMin = 0
    path,
    recipient,
    block.timestamp
);
```

**Impact:**
- MEV bots or manipulators can front-run tax conversions to extract value, causing tax proceeds to be significantly less than expected.
- Increases effective cost to holders via additional price impact.

**Location:**
`swapTokensForUSD1()`

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:**
> - Implement slippage limits based on TWAP/price or configurable `amountOutMin` with a safe buffer (e.g., 1-3%).
> - Randomize/limit conversion sizes and frequency to reduce predictability.

---

#### 🟡 [M-2] Single-Pair Tax Detection—Taxes Not Applied on Other Pools

**Description:**
The contract only marks a single `lpPair` against `USD1` as an AMM pair. Taxes are computed based on `isAMMPair[to]` or `isAMMPair[from]`. Other pools (e.g., `BEPE-WBNB`) would not be recognized, enabling tax bypass via alternative pairs.

```solidity
mapping(address => bool) public isAMMPair;
// only this is set:
isAMMPair[lpPair] = true;
```

**Impact:**
- Users can trade through unrecognized pools to avoid taxes.
- Inconsistent tokenomics and potential market fragmentation.

**Location:**
`constructor`, `handleTax()`, use of `isAMMPair`.

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:**
> - Add owner-governed functions to register/unregister additional AMM pairs.
> - Consider pattern-based recognition or DEX factory validation to cover common pools.

---

#### 🟡 [M-3] Centralized Fund-Sweeping Controls (Marketing-Only Rescue, Open Trigger)

**Description:**
- `rescueTokens()` can only be called by `marketingAddress` (not `owner`), and always sends rescued tokens to `marketingAddress`.
- `withdrawStuckBNB()` is callable by anyone and sweeps all native coins to `marketingAddress`.

```solidity
function withdrawStuckBNB() external {
    (success, ) = address(marketingAddress).call{ value: address(this).balance }("");
}

function rescueTokens(address _token) external {
    require(msg.sender == marketingAddress, "Not marketing");
    ...
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(_token), address(marketingAddress), _contractBalance);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Concentrates custody in `marketingAddress`; if compromised or malicious, funds can be siphoned.
- Owner renunciation would not remove these powers if `marketingAddress` is retained by the team.

**Location:**
`withdrawStuckBNB()`, `rescueTokens()`

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:**
> - Restrict both functions to `onlyOwner` or a multisig; add a timelock for transparency.
> - Consider allowing configurable recipient or DAO governance for rescues.

#### 🟢 [L-1] Router Pre-Approved to Spend Deployer’s Entire Balance

**Description:**
In the constructor, the router is approved to spend the deployer’s entire token balance. While often used to seed liquidity, this may be surprising if the deployer changes.

```solidity
_approve(address(msg.sender), address(dexRouter), totalSupply());
```

**Impact:**
- If the router or integration is compromised, deployer funds might be at risk (though Pancake V2 router is widely trusted).
- Operational surprise for the deployer.

**Location:**
`constructor`

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:**
> - Approve exact amounts on demand during liquidity provision.
> - Optionally remove the pre-approval and perform approvals off-chain as needed.

---

#### 🟢 [L-2] Anyone Can Trigger `withdrawStuckBNB()` (Sends to Marketing)

**Description:**
Anyone can call `withdrawStuckBNB()`, which forwards all native balance to `marketingAddress`. While recipient is fixed, the trigger being public may be unexpected.

```solidity
function withdrawStuckBNB() external {
    (success, ) = address(marketingAddress).call{ value: address(this).balance }("");
}
```

**Impact:**
- No loss of funds (always sent to `marketingAddress`), but third parties control timing.
- Potential for nuisance triggering or confusion.

**Location:**
`withdrawStuckBNB()`

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:**
> - Add `onlyOwner` or an auth check if you want to control timing.
> - Emit an event when sweeping for transparency.

---

### Good Practices

- Uses Solidity 0.8.26 with built-in overflow checks.
- Libraries (`Address`, `SafeERC20`) align with OpenZeppelin patterns; no malicious modifications detected.
- `Ownable` appears standard; renunciation sets `owner` to `address(0)` with no backdoor variables.
- Taxes fixed at deployment (2% buy/sell); no owner function to increase tax post-deploy.
- Swapback throttled by `lastSwapBackBlock + 1` to avoid multiple swaps in the same block.
- `try/catch` around swaps to prevent revert cascades during conversions.

### Tokenomics Analysis

| Feature | Value/Status | Risk Assessment |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Contract Type | Standard (non-upgradeable) | Low (no upgrade risk) |
| Upgrade Control | N/A | Low |
| Ownership Status | Active | High (centralized control) |
| Owner Address | 0x298edF321dB2ac388A38818E396605d7cE3DCE40 | Current admin |
| Total Supply | 420,000,000,000 BEPE (9 decimals) | Low |
| Buy Tax | 2% | Low |
| Sell Tax | 2% | Low |
| Max Transaction | None | Low |

- Taxes: On buys/sells via the recognized AMM pair, 2% of the amount is redirected to the contract, then periodically swapped to `USD1`. The proceeds are split 60% to `marketingAddress` and 40% to `devAddress`.
- Swap Threshold: `swapTokensAtAmt` defaults to 0.05% of the total supply, owner-adjustable within [0.001%, 0.5%] of supply.
- Centralization: Owner can set fee exemptions and change marketing/dev recipients. `marketingAddress` can always sweep tokens, and anyone can sweep BNB to `marketingAddress`.
- Market Mechanics: Only the constructor-created `BEPE-USD1` pair is treated as an AMM pair; trades via other pools would not incur taxes. Conversions route directly to `USD1`, which may pose liquidity/value risks if `USD1` is not a widely traded asset.
- Rug Risk: No mint/burn after deployment, no blacklist, and no dynamic tax increase capability detected. However, tax proceeds and rescue/sweep functions are fully custodial to team wallets. Balanced Assessment: While not upgradeable (reducing direct rug vectors), centralized custody and `USD1` routing require trust in the team and `USD1` market integrity.

**Balanced Assessment:** Upgradeability is absent (reducing governance risk), but centralized custody and a non-standard tax-out token (`USD1`) increase trust requirements. If `USD1` maintains deep, independent liquidity, risks are reduced; if not, conversions may be value-destructive.

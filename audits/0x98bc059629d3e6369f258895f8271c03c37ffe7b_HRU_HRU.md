### Summary

`CpboxToken` is a standard `ERC20` token built on unmodified OpenZeppelin `v5.3.0` libraries, with a constructor-settable `decimals()` override and a fixed initial mint to the deployer. There are no taxes, no blacklist/whitelist logic, no pausing, and no upgradeability or owner/admin roles in the code. The implementation is straightforward and minimal, with no external calls or custom fee logic. Overall Risk: LOW – Minimal surface area, standard OZ implementation, no privileged controls.

### Risk Assessment

Token Quick Facts:

| Property | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Buy Tax | None | ✅ Low |
| Sell Tax | None | ✅ Low |
| Max Transaction | None | ✅ Reasonable |
| Contract Type | Standard | Info |
| Ownership | None (no owner pattern) | ✅ Safe |
| Pause Function | No | ✅ No restrictions |

Security Assessment:

| Category | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Security | Low | Standard OZ ERC20, no external calls/tax logic |
| Centralization | Low | No owner/admin; fixed mint at deployer only |
| Code Quality | Low | Clean, minimal; uses OZ v5.3.0 without mods |
| Exploit Likelihood | Low | No attack surface beyond standard ERC20 transfers |
| **Overall Risk Score** | **100/100** | No findings (critical/high/medium/low = 0) |

## On-Chain Function Results

| Function | On-Chain Value | Explanation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `decimals()` | `18` | Token uses 18 decimal places for unit denomination |
| `name()` | `HRU` | Contract name identifier |
| `symbol()` | `HRU` | Ticker symbol used by UIs and DEXs |
| `totalSupply()` | `1000000000000000000000000` | Total tokens minted at deployment (1,000,000 HRU with 18 decimals) |

### Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Key Issues |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Critical | 0 | — |
| High | 0 | — |
| Medium | 0 | — |
| Low | 0 | — |

### Critical Findings

None.

### Good Practices

- Uses unmodified OpenZeppelin `v5.3.0` `ERC20` implementation with custom errors and `_update()` pattern
- No upgradeability or proxy pattern involved (immutable logic)
- No owner/admin roles; no backdoor or fake renunciation vectors
- No external calls in token logic (reduces reentrancy/MEV vectors)
- Fixed supply minted only in constructor; no further mint/burn functions

### Tokenomics Analysis

| Feature | Value/Status | Risk Assessment |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Contract Type | Standard | Low |
| Upgrade Control | None (no proxy) | Low |
| Ownership Status | No owner/admin roles | Low |
| Owner Address | N/A | N/A |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000 HRU (18 decimals) | Low |
| Buy Tax | None | Low |
| Sell Tax | None | Low |
| Max Transaction | None | Low |

Details:
- Initial supply is minted to the deployer at construction; thereafter, supply is fixed (no `mint()`/`burn()` exposed).
- No taxes, no fees, no transfer restrictions. No blacklist/whitelist or limits, so no honeypot behavior from code.
- The `decimals()` override is constructor-configurable; on-chain shows `18`, which is standard and compatible with DEX/UX expectations.

Balanced Assessment:
- There is no proxy or upgrade pattern. Users do not need to trust an upgrade authority.
- No ownership or admin role exists; there is no renunciation surface, and no hidden restore/backdoor pattern.
- The design favors simplicity and safety, minimizing attack surface and centralization risk.

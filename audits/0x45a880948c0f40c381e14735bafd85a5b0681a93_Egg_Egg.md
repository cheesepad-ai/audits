## 🤖 Analysis #1: GPT-5

**Completed:** Fri, 12 Dec 2025 19:10:23 GMT

### Summary

This is a simple standard `ERC20`-like token (`Egg`) with no fees/taxes and a one-time `tradingActive` gate to control pre-launch transfers. The owner can whitelist addresses to bypass the trading lock and can set a `fundAddress` that can withdraw stuck assets. No proxy or upgradeability is present; supply is fixed. Overall, the code is straightforward with minimal attack surface; the primary risks are centralization before launch and standard ERC20 allowance race conditions. Overall Risk: LOW – No critical vulns; minor centralization and UX risks pre-launch.

### Risk Assessment

**Token Quick Facts:**

| Property | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|

None.

### Medium Findings

#### 🟡 [M-1] Trading Lock Can Block All Transfers Until Owner Enables Trading

**Description:**
All transfers require `tradingActive == true` or either party whitelisted via `_isExcludedFromTradingLock`. Before `tradingActive` is enabled, non-whitelisted addresses cannot transfer. If liquidity is added prematurely without proper whitelisting (e.g., pair/router), buys/sells will revert, effectively blocking trading. Post-activation, the lock has no effect (one-way enable).

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    ...
    require(
        tradingActive ||
            _isExcludedFromTradingLock[from] ||
            _isExcludedFromTradingLock[to],
        "Trading is not active"
    );
    ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- Pre-launch: Trading can be unintentionally or intentionally blocked; users may face failed transactions and gas loss.
- Misconfiguration risk: If LP added while `tradingActive == false` and pair/router not whitelisted, trading is impossible until fixed.

**Location:**
`_transfer()` require gate.

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:** Operational safeguards:
> 1. Before adding liquidity, either enable `tradingActive` or whitelist router and pair addresses.
> 2. Announce trading enablement beforehand to avoid failed transactions.
> - Alternative: Consider two-way pause with timelock/governance if runtime control is desired.

#### 🟡 [M-2] Single-Owner Control Pre-Launch and Centralized Asset Rescue Role

**Description:**
A single EOA controls `onlyOwner` functions (`enableTrading()`, `excludeFromTradingLock()`, `setFundAddress()`), and `fundAddress` (initially owner) can withdraw any native currency or ERC20 tokens from the contract. Ownership can be renounced, but `fundAddress` retains rescue powers post-renounce.

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() { require(msg.sender == _owner, "Caller is not the owner"); _; }
modifier onlyFundAddress() { require(msg.sender == fundAddress, "Caller is not the fund address"); _; }

function setFundAddress(address newFundAddress) external onlyOwner {
    require(newFundAddress != address(0), "Cannot set zero address");
    fundAddress = newFundAddress;
}
function rescueBNB() external onlyFundAddress { ... }
function rescueToken(address token) external onlyFundAddress { ... }
```

**Impact:**
- Trust required in owner pre-launch to configure trading whitelist correctly.
- `fundAddress` can always extract tokens/BNB held by the contract (intended for recovery), which is centralization of recovery powers.

**Location:**
Access control modifiers and `rescueBNB()`/`rescueToken()`/`setFundAddress()`.

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:** Reduce centralization/trust:
> 1. Use a multisig for `owner` and `fundAddress`.
> 2. Publish `fundAddress` and its policy; consider timelock for changing it.
> - Alternative: If not needed post-launch, set `fundAddress` to a multisig or burn-capable recovery contract.

#### 🟢 [L-1] ERC20 Allowance Race Condition (Standard Approval Issue)

**Description:**
Using `approve()` to change a non-zero allowance to another non-zero value can enable the well-known race condition where a spender front-runs the change.

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
    _approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);
    return true;
}
```

**Impact:**
Potential double-spend by a malicious spender during allowance updates.

**Location:**
`approve()` and allowance logic.

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:** User guidance and safer patterns:
> - Recommend setting allowance to zero before increasing, or use `increaseAllowance()/decreaseAllowance()`.
> - Optionally enforce zero-first in `approve()` (may break integrations).

---

#### 🟢 [L-2] Missing Event Emission on `fundAddress` Updates

**Description:**
`setFundAddress()` changes a sensitive admin address without emitting a dedicated event, reducing on-chain transparency for monitoring.

```solidity
function setFundAddress(address newFundAddress) external onlyOwner {
    require(newFundAddress != address(0), "Cannot set zero address");
    fundAddress = newFundAddress;
}
```

**Impact:**
Off-chain indexers and users may miss critical admin changes.

**Location:**
`setFundAddress()`.

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:** Emit an event:
> - Add `event FundAddressUpdated(address indexed previous, address indexed current);`
> - Emit it in `setFundAddress()`.

### Good Practices

- Fixed `totalSupply` with no mint/burn functions (supply immutable).
- No fees, taxes, or blacklist mechanisms in transfer logic post-activation.
- Ownership renunciation is final (no backdoor or restore mechanism present).
- Minimal external calls; return value checks on ERC20 `transfer` in `rescueToken`.
- Solidity 0.8.7 overflow/underflow checks; prudent `unchecked` usage with prior bounds checks.
- Not a proxy; no upgradeability or `delegatecall` patterns detected.

### Tokenomics Analysis

| Feature | Value/Status | Risk Assessment |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Contract Type | Standard (non-upgradeable) | Low |
| Upgrade Control | None | Low |
| Ownership Status | Active (EOA) | Medium |
| Owner Address | 0xa7F753936fd45a7b302116e5F0fcE8FF0adEa2d1 | Current owner |
| Total Supply | 21,000,000 × 10^9 (9 decimals) | Low |
| Buy Tax | None | Low |
| Sell Tax | None | Low |
| Max Transaction | None | Low |

- Trading control: `tradingActive` must be enabled once; before that, only whitelisted addresses can transfer. After enabling, transfers are unrestricted by this gate.
- No reflective mechanics, no fees, no automatic liquidity or burn features.
- `fundAddress` can rescue BNB/tokens from the contract; this is operationally useful but centralized. Post-renounce, `fundAddress` remains empowered unless reassigned beforehand.
- Rug-pull considerations: No functions alter balances arbitrarily, no mint/burn, and no upgradeability. The primary pre-launch risk is operational—misconfigured whitelist/trading enablement could block trading. Once `tradingActive` is set to true, there is no built-in mechanism to halt trading or impose fees.

Ownership Renunciation Verification:
- Currently, `owner()` is an active EOA. If renounced, no code paths exist to restore ownership or bypass `onlyOwner`. This indicates proper renunciation (no hidden backdoor). However, `fundAddress` powers are independent and persist after renounce by design.

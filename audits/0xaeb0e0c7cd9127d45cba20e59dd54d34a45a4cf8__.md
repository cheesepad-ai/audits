## 🤖 Analysis #1: GPT-5

**Completed:** Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:03:08 GMT

### Summary

This is a standard `ERC20` token (`CheesePadStandardToken`) with fixed supply set at deployment and no owner/admin controls. It forwards an ETH deployment fee to a specified `feeReceiver` in the constructor and allows customizable `decimals` (<= 18). No taxes, blacklists, or special transfer logic exist. Overall the implementation is minimal and aligns closely with OpenZeppelin v5.5.0 patterns with no upgradeability. Overall Risk: LOW – Simple, fixed-supply token with no privileged controls; only minor business-logic consideration around the constructor fee.

### Risk Assessment

**Token Quick Facts:**

| Property | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Buy Tax | None | ✅ Low |
| Sell Tax | None | ✅ Low |
| Max Transaction | None | ✅ Reasonable |
| Contract Type | Standard | Info only |
| Ownership | No owner roles | ✅ Safe |
| Pause Function | No | ✅ No restrictions |

**Security Assessment:**

| Category | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Security | Low | Minimal surface area; no external calls post-deploy |
| Centralization | Low | No owner/admin; fixed supply; no upgradeability |
| Code Quality | Low | Clean, OZ-style; constructor fee logic could be clearer |
| Exploit Likelihood | Low | No fee/tax/AMM hooks; no complex logic |
| **Overall Risk Score** | **99/100** | One low-severity business-logic concern only |

### Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Key Issues |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Critical | 0 | — |
| High | 0 | — |
| Medium | 0 | — |
| Low | 1 | Constructor fee is developer-specified and bypassable |

### Critical Findings

#### 🟢 [L-1] Constructor fee is caller-controlled and can be set to zero (bypassable without an enforcing factory)

**Description:**
The constructor enforces that `msg.value == feeAmount_` and forwards `msg.value` to `feeReceiver_`, but both `feeAmount_` and `feeReceiver_` are provided by the deployer. If this is intended to enforce a platform fee (e.g., Launchpad), a deployer can set `feeAmount_ = 0` and send `0` ether to bypass payment entirely unless an external factory/registry enforces these parameters.

```solidity
constructor(
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    uint8 decimals_,
    uint256 totalSupply_,
    address payable feeReceiver_,
    uint256 feeAmount_
) payable ERC20(name_, symbol_) {
    require(decimals_ <= 18, "Decimals too large");
    require(feeReceiver_ != address(0), "Invalid fee receiver");
    require(msg.value == feeAmount_, "Invalid fee value");

    _tokenDecimals = decimals_;

    (bool ok, ) = feeReceiver_.call{value: msg.value}("");
    require(ok, "Fee transfer failed");

    uint256 scaledSupply = totalSupply_ * (10 ** uint256(decimals_));
    _mint(msg.sender, scaledSupply);
}
```

**Impact:**
If a platform expects guaranteed fee collection, users can deploy without paying any fee by setting `feeAmount_ = 0`. This is not a token-holder security risk but can undermine platform revenue or business logic.

**Location:**
`CheesePadStandardToken` constructor.

**💡 Recommendation:**
> **Action Required:** Enforce fee terms off-chain or via a trusted factory that:
> 1. Hardcodes `feeReceiver` and fee schedule
> 2. Deploys token contracts directly and verifies constructor args on-chain
> - Alternative: Remove `feeAmount_` parameter and enforce a fixed fee or use a factory to collect and forward fees before deployment.

### Good Practices

- Uses OpenZeppelin-style `ERC20` with `IERC20Errors` (v5.5.0 pattern), no custom transfer logic.
- No owner/admin roles, no blacklist/whitelist, no taxes; fixed supply minted at deployment.
- `decimals` stored as immutable and overridden cleanly.
- No upgradeability or proxies; minimizes trust assumptions and complexity.
- No external calls in operational functions; single external call only in constructor to `feeReceiver`.

### Tokenomics Analysis

| Feature | Value/Status | Risk Assessment |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Contract Type | Standard `ERC20` | Low |
| Upgrade Control | None (not upgradeable) | Low |
| Ownership Status | No owner/admin | Low |
| Owner Address | N/A | N/A |
| Total Supply | Set at deployment (`totalSupply_ * 10^decimals`) | Low |
| Buy Tax | None | Low |
| Sell Tax | None | Low |
| Max Transaction | None | Low |

The token has a fixed total supply minted to the deployer during construction. There are no taxes, fee-on-transfer mechanics, trading limits, blacklists, or pausability. There are no honeypot patterns: transfers rely solely on standard `ERC20` logic with no custom conditions. Liquidity/lock mechanics are outside this contract. Because there is no owner or upgrade path, rug vectors via parameter changes are not present within this contract.

Additional notes:
- The deployment fee forwarding is a deployment-time-only action and does not affect runtime behavior.
- No proxy or delegatecall-based upgradeability, thus no upgrade governance risks.

Ownership Renunciation Verification:
- Not applicable; there is no `owner` or privileged role implemented, and no hidden backdoors or restore functions detected.

Proxy Contract Detection:
- None. No EIP-1967/1822 slots, no `delegatecall`, and no upgrade hooks.
